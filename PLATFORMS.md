## Platforms
There are so many platforms out there that could help you find a remote job. They operate in a variety of ways but they're usually like a middle-man that connect you with companies that are looking for talent. You create a profile on the platforms and then go through a series of steps before landing a job. You would want to showcase your skills and achievements on your profile because companies want to hire you for your skills. You need to be able to bring something to the table.
